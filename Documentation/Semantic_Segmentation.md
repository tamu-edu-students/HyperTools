# Semantic Segmentation Tool: 
## Overview
New contour approximation method which provides a label to pixels in the image based on vegetation, land, and water. The classification is determined by the spectral library, if there is no classifications then it is just rendered as the closest assumed segmentation.

### Show Original Image:
Displays the original Classified Imageâ€™s contour approximation of the semantic map of the area.

### Min Countour Area (m^2):
Changes the minimum amount of square meters in relation to pixels to be rendered in the updated image. Increasing the minimum(+) helps to reduce noise in the image by filtering out polygons below a certain size.

### Polygon Approximation Coefficient:
Approximate polygons through increasing the approximation coefficient(+) which reduces the number of vertices in a polygon.

### Show Differences
Finds the edge of all objects by determining where the contour color changes in comparison to the surrounding pixels. The image is then reproduced with the edge highlighted in white demonstrating high contrast against the black background.

### Edge Detection: 
Creates a copy of the incoming image in terms of size (length and width) and initialize as an all black image. Displays black and white image of white outlines of edges of the contour image.

### Show Contours:
Displays image of contour image.
